C-ROADS Change Log
===================

**By the Climate Interactive Team**

*Last updated January 2020*

`C-ROADS <https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/c-roads/>`_ is a free, award-winning computer simulator that helps people understand the long-term climate impacts of national and regional greenhouse gas emission reductions at the global level. C-ROADS has helped the world to understand the `impact of the emission reduction pledges <https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/scoreboard/>`_ countries have proposed to the United Nations. These proposals take different forms with different reference and target years, however, using C-ROADS we can rapidly test these policies to determine whether collectively they are enough to stabilize temperature below 2Â°C. C-ROADS World Climate is made available for free to make insights about what it takes to address climate change more accessible. We encourage you to use C-ROADS as part of a `World Climate Simulation <https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/world-climate-simulation/>`_, where a group of people play the roles of UN climate negotiators working to create an agreement to limit global warming.

C-ROADS is being developed by `Climate Interactive <http://www.climateinteractive.org/>`_, `Ventana Systems <http://www.ventanasystems.com/>`_, Todd Fincannon, and `UML Climate Change Initiative <http://www.uml.edu/Research/Climate-Change/>`_.
